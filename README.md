## About this project
Make pth readable. \
This project can write json file from pth and can write the pth again from the json. \
model.pth <--> model.json

## Installation

```

### For develop

```
And then install
```bash

pip install -e .
```

## Usage

*For now this is only working with [`encode`, `decode`] commands*

### decode from pth to json
```bash
rpth decode -i test/models/model_small.pth -o test/models/model_small.json 
```

### encode from json to pth
```bash
rpth encode -i test/models/model_small.json -o test/models/model_small_restored.pth
```

## Test
For testing with small model run:
```bash
cd test
python test_small_net.py
```

# TODO:
- [ ] Add the ability to use any torch version 
- [ ] add args to map_location (CPU/GPU) when writing pth file
